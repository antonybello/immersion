# Immersion in p(art)s

We invite you to immerse yourself in an audiovisual voyage, to dilate your eyes and ears to sensory numbness. Immerse yourself in four thalassic realms, each, some, all, apart, together, again. Sink––or float––in the whelm of the tide. Explore and indulge in the harmonies between sums and parts.

Submission to The Balcony art exhibition at Pitzer College.
